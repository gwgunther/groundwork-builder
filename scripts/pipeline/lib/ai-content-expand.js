# Guidance specific to this kind of page

${kindGuidance}

# Universal principles (apply at all times)

- **No fabrication.** Do not invent credentials, statistics, awards, or quotes. If you don't know whether the practice offers something, write generally about the topic, not a claim about this practice.
- **No generic boilerplate.** Avoid phrases like "your trusted partner", "second to none", "we care about your smile", "comprehensive care", or "your healthiest smile starts here". These are template tells.
- **Direct answer up top.** Within the first two paragraphs, plainly answer the obvious question this page is about. LLMs need an extractable answer.
- **Comprehensive coverage.** A reader skimming H2s should see the structure of the topic. Use 3–5 H2 subheadings to organize. Use markdown ## for subheads.
- **Specifics over marketing.** Concrete: "A typical filling appointment takes 30–60 minutes." Generic: "We make sure you're comfortable." Choose the concrete every time.
- **One FAQ block at the end** with 3–5 real questions a patient would ask, answered plainly. This is gold for AI citation.
- **Local context** mentioned 1–3 times naturally (the city, neighborhood, "patients in ${city || 'the area'}"). Don't keyword-stuff.
- **Markdown output.** Use ## for subheadings, paragraphs separated by blank lines, plain bullet lists where natural.

# Output format

Return ONLY the expanded markdown body. No frontmatter. No title heading at the top (the page already has an H1). Start with the opening paragraph, end with the FAQ section.`;
