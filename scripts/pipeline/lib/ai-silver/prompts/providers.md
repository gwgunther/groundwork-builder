You are extracting EVERY provider (doctor + non-doctor staff) listed on a dental practice website.

# Inputs

WEBSITE: {{baseUrl}}

## Pages (team/staff/doctor bio pages + homepage, with full body text)

{{pageContext}}

## Person / Dentist JSON-LD found across the site

{{personLdJson}}

## Image candidates for headshots (selected by alt/src patterns)

{{photoCandidates}}

# Required output

Return ONE strict JSON object with two arrays: `doctors[]` and `staff[]`. Strict JSON — every embedded `"` MUST be backslash-escaped. No markdown, no comments, no trailing commas.

# Hard rules — read every one

1. **CAPTURE EVERY PROVIDER** — including departing/retiring ones, incoming/new providers, providers whose photos appear but bios are brief. NO editorial filtering. Whether they're "currently practicing" is a downstream decision, NOT yours.
2. **VERBATIM** — bios, education entries, certifications, status notes are copied exactly as written. Do not paraphrase, summarize, or improve grammar.
3. **NULL OVER FABRICATION** — if a provider has no bio paragraph on the site, set `bio: null`. NEVER substitute the practice's mission/about/welcome paragraph as their bio.
4. **statusNote is the gatekeeper for status info** — if the site says "Dr. Smith is retiring after 30 years" or "Dr. Jones joined us in 2024" or "Dr. Brown has been in continuous practice for 40 years", copy that exact phrase into `statusNote`. Do NOT exclude the provider based on the status.
5. **DOCTORS vs STAFF** — anyone with DDS/DMD/MD/BDS or addressed as "Dr." goes in `doctors[]`. Hygienists (RDH), assistants (DA/CDA/RDA), front-office, treatment coordinators go in `staff[]`.
6. **Photo matching** — match a provider photo when:
   - alt text mentions their first OR last name
   - filename includes their name fragment (e.g. `img-dr-cortez.jpg` → Dr. Cortez)
   - alt text starts with "Staff member:" → staff bucket
   If multiple matches, pick the one whose alt/src best identifies the person. If no clear match, set photoUrl null rather than guess.
7. **educationList ENTRIES ARE SEPARATE** — split each degree/certificate/cert program into its own array entry. Do not collapse "DDS USC; pediatric cert Yale" into one string.
8. **rank** — for `doctors[]`, assign `rank: 1, 2, 3, ...` in the order they appear on the site (or in source-order on the team/about page). Rank is a presentation hint, NOT a status filter.
9. **No primary distinction** — do NOT pick a "primary" doctor. Every provider is equally captured.
10. **JSON-LD priority** — if `Person`/`Dentist` JSON-LD exists, prefer it for name/credentials but still pull bio from the visible bio paragraph on the page.
11. **Empty arrays, never omit** — if a provider has no `certifications`, return `"certifications": []`. Do not omit the key.
12. **Credentials: capture the FULL string verbatim** — the letters that follow a provider's name (e.g. "DDS, MS, FACD, ICD", "DMD, MS"). Look right after the name in headings, bios, and page titles. Each doctor almost always has a credentials string — find it. Do not leave credentials null if any letters appear after the name anywhere on the site.
13. **Staff organizations/memberships** — if a staff member's bio lists professional memberships (e.g. "member of the American Dental Hygiene Association, California Dental Hygienists' Association"), capture them in that staff member's `organizations[]` (add the field for staff too).

Return ONLY the JSON object.
